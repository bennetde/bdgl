Small Open GL Project that I wrote in C++ and CMake following the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) Tutorial.
So far this just contains some spinning cubes with depth testing and a first-person controllable camera.

## Build steps
1. Clone using --recurse-submodules
2. Create a build directory, inside that build directory, call `cmake ..`
3. To build, call `cmake --build .`
